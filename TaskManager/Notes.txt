One of the example is mounted() lifecycle hook: It is run when the componnet is fully created and added to the screen (DOM).

Template refs: It is a way of getting the dom function and access/manipulate it using ref inside ypur template.

watchEffect is a Vue 3 function that automatically tracks reactive dependencies and runs whenever they change.
