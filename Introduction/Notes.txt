Vue.js is a framework i.e. it has short codes, boiler plate code that makes coding the frontend easy. Vue helps in making websites reactive and interactive.
For example: In Javascript you have write a longer code to click a button that increments count and diplays it but Vue gives inbuilt code that can make the code smaller in return making it easier to manage and easier to read.

Vue is declarative and reactive.
Declarative because you tell what the UI should look like and don't have to worry about updating the DOM separately.
It is done by declaring by using {{ }}.
For example: <p> {{ message }} </p>
Using this, you can what you want on the UI to be seen.

Reactive because whenever you change the value of the declared component it automatically gets updated. In javascript, code needs to be written to update DOM.
Taking the previous example: When you update message, it will automatically get updated on the UI.
