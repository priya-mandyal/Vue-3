Ref: Ref is used to reactivity in Vue.
Code example:
let message = ref("hi");
// to change, use .value
message.value = "Bye";
This change will be automatcally updated on the UI.

Computed(): It helps recalculate logic when its dependencies changes.
Code example:
let age = ref(null);
let canDrive = computed (
  () => {
    age >= 18 ? "Yes" :"No"
}
)
// WHenever age value changes canDrive will be recalculated.


Starter code explained: 
// get createApp an dref from Vue
    const { createApp, ref } = Vue;
    // App is something you need to have to start with Vue
    const App = {
        // setup is where your code/logic goes
      setup() {
        // all the methods you want to trigger or values you want to show needs to be returned here
        return {
            message: "Hello"
        }
        
      },
    };
